### Introduction

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Natural language processing (NLP) refers to the branch of Computer Science and more specifically, the branch of Artificial Intelligence or AI concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.

- **Sentiment Analysis:** Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a natural language processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether data is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is often performed on textual data to help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer needs.

In this Project, we'll develop a **Sentiment Analysis Model** to categorize a tweet as **Positive or Negative**.
